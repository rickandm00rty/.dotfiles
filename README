Terminal:

Currently using vim with:

Window Manager:
Currently attempting to use Kitty startup sessions, but might use TMUX:
 - No special TMUX configs at the moment but TMUX messes with my color scheming in vim and I haven't figured that out yet. Kitty startup sessions might be more elegent. 
 - Eventually want to move to i3 as a tiling manager but learning vim first
