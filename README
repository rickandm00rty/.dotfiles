Terminal:
Currently using Xfce4-terminal with:
  - Tmux Startup
  - Oh-My-Zsh w/ "awesomepanda" theme
  - Whatever terminal supports image and fullscreen launching, currently qterminal
  
Editor:
Currently using nvim with:
  - Theme (Fluctuates, currently Dracula)
  - Vim-plug plugin manager
  - fzf Fuzzy Finder
  - NERDTree Explorer
  - Dracula Icon themes
  - Airline
  
Window Manager:
Attempted to use Kitty Sessions but for what I need, TMUX really does everything and is lighter weight:
 - No special TMUX configs at the moment other than matching the status bar line color with my terminal background
 - Eventually want to move to a tiling manager, but will need more practice for that
