I am distro agnostic although I tend to prefer Fedora. Choose whatever suits you best and just be aware of the package manager needed. 
This script can be improved by detecting the environment the script is running in and placing the appropriate package manager commands via a variable but I am too lazy for that at the moment. 
Feel free to fork and add that if you would like.  

Tools I use daily include:
	- i3
	- NVIM
	- XFCE Terminal (Simple and I do not need GPU Rendering)
	- Oh-My-Zsh (Shell Theming and Plugin Support)
	- TMUX
	- appImageLauncher
	- Obsidian (Notes)
	- Microsoft Edge (Browser and YouTube/Twitch/Twitter/Reddit)
	- Remmina (RDP)
	- Sublime Text (Backup Notes - I am still Learning VIM)
	- Discord
	- GIMP
	- gnome-disks
	- OTHERS
	
First Steps (Remember: this is experimental, commands in teh script may simply fail/need adjustments which is why I recommend a fork or editing locally)
-----------
- Install preferred base distro (Currently Fedora 35 i3 Spinf or me)
- Reboot & Login
- sudo dnf update & upgrade
- sudo dnf install git
- git clone https://GitHub.com/rickandm00rty/dotfiles
- cd dotfiles
- sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
- sudo ./install.sh

After the script finishes I typically just start playing around and filling in any gaps (Graphic Drivers (if needed) and Installing Edge Apps/Password Manager). 
This is a VERY rough outline and factors will change greatly depending on your environment. My main goal was easy readability and control over variables, so it should be easy to customize although you'll need to be familiar of dependencies needed.
